#### In the 2015 game Super Mario Maker, people from around the world are able to design their
own Mario levels and upload them for the world to play. Over time, certain styles of levels grew
in popularity and solidified as level types (e.g., speedrun levels, puzzle levels, automatic levels,
music levels, costume levels, etc.). After seeing a level, you have the option to star it (to show
your support for the creator) or not. You might say that a level is “likeable” if at least 20% of
the people that played it (played column in data set) gave it a star (liked column). Using the
data set SMMLevels, determine if the percentage of likeable puzzle levels is different than the
percentage of likeable speedrun levels using a hypothesis test with α = 0.02. Begin your analysis
by removing any level that was played by fewer than 10 people. Include your code and results.

```{r}
data = read.csv('SMMLevels.csv', head=T) #load the dataset
puz = data[which(data$tag=='Puzzle' & data$played >=10),] #remove all the levels that was played by fewer than 10 people
spd = data[which(data$tag=='Speedrun' & data$played >=10),] #sort out the data 
lpuz = puz[which(puz$liked/puz$played>=0.2),] #sort out the likeable data
lspd = spd[which(spd$liked/spd$played>=0.2),] 

n = nrow(lpuz)
m = nrow(lspd)
p_x = nrow(puz)
p_y = nrow(spd)

prop.test(c(n,m),c(p_x,p_y), alternative = 'two.sided', correct = F)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
